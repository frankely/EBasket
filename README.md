## Unit Testing

The following project follows Test Driven Development and relies on xUnit, AutoFixture and Moq.

#### What is TDD?

TDD is an innovative software development approach where tests are written, before writing the bare minimum of code required for the test to be fulfilled. The code will then be refactored, as often as necessary, in order to pass the test, with the process being repeated for each piece of functionality. The below illustration shows how it works. To summarize, write minimal code and refactor continuously in order to satisfy the test.
